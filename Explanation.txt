The included data file contains details about “leads”, where a lead is a person who wants to take up a course 
with “SomeSchool”, a college. Every row contains information about one lead. 
Those leads with “Closed” in the Lead Stage column are the people who have actually paid for the course.

The purpose of the exercise is to determine which leads are more likely to close. 
A score should be assigned to each lead, with the possible values of “High”, “Medium” and “Low”, where “High” 
means that the lead is most likely to pay, and “Low” means least likely.
